"""Read-only access to an external PR knowledge base, task-agnostic.

This module exposes the `read_pr_library(pr_number)` MCP tool. The
data backing the tool lives under `<task_pkg>/knowledge/pr_library/`,
where each candidate PR has its own markdown file under tier
subdirectories.

The PR library is NOT bundled with this release. Users who want to
populate it can drop their own per-PR markdown files into
`<task_pkg>/knowledge/pr_library/L2/pr_NNNN_<title>.md` and (optionally)
extracted source under
`<task_pkg>/knowledge/pr_library/L2/src/pr_NNNN/`. With no library
present, the tool returns a not-found error and the agent simply uses
WebSearch and WebFetch as the primary research channel.

Knowledge-base location is read from the active task adapter
(`current_adapter().knowledge_dir`) so the same helper works for any
task that has its own PR-style external library.
