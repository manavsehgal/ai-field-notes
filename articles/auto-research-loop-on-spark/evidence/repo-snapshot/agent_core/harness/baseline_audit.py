"""Baseline audit — detect workdir <> package-root baseline mismatches.

At supervisor startup, hash `multi_agent/train_gpt.py` (the canonical
seed) and each existing `workdir_<spec>/train_gpt.py` (agent's current
file). Any workdir whose hash differs from the baseline is "stale" —
left over from a previous baseline era that a recent commit / operator
edit has since replaced at the package root.

By default we only REPORT. Wiping stale train_gpt.py files (so that
`tools.submit._stage_workdir` re-seeds them from the new baseline on
the next iter) requires explicit operator opt-in via
`--reset-stale-workdirs`.

Design notes
------------
* Zero blackboard coupling. We only touch `train_gpt.py` under
  `multi_agent/` and each `workdir_<spec>/`. `results.tsv`, `best.json`,
  `tree.tsv`, `events.jsonl`, `snapshots/` are all untouched. Historical
  data survives every audit run.
* Runs once at supervisor startup (core.run), never per-iter. Hashing
  a ~86 KB file a handful of times is microseconds.
* `fresh` (workdir has no train_gpt.py yet, e.g. first supervisor run
  on a new host) is a silent, expected state: `_stage_workdir` will
  seed it on first iter. We just note it in the audit log.

Contract with `_stage_workdir`
------------------------------
`_stage_workdir` (tools/submit.py) seeds only when
`workdir/train_gpt.py` is MISSING. So deleting the file here is both
necessary AND sufficient to trigger a re-seed — we don't need to touch
any other workdir content.
