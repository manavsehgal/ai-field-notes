"""DoerBase — the SDK-facing skeleton every specialist subclasses.

Concurrency model
─────────────────
One iter = one SDK session = one DoerBase.run_once() call. The session
carries extended-thinking state through its tool-use turns, but DOES NOT
persist across iters — fresh blackboard read on every entry.

SDK integration
───────────────
`claude_agent_sdk.ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(...))` is the
canonical entrypoint. If the SDK isn't importable (local dev), run_once()
raises RuntimeError rather than silently returning — that's the signal to
run via the supervisor on the head node where the SDK is installed.

Tool binding
────────────
Custom tools (syntax_check, size_project, param_count, read_snapshot,
rebase_to, submit_trial) are registered through an in-process MCP server
built with `create_sdk_mcp_server(name="apg", ...)`. The SDK surfaces
them to the model under the namespace `mcp__apg__<tool_name>` — that's
what must appear in `allowed_tools`. Each decorated tool is an
`SdkMcpTool` instance carrying its JSONSchema via `.input_schema`, so
the SDK can auto-derive what the model sees.

WebSearch / WebFetch / Read / Edit / Bash are SDK built-ins — we enable
them by name in the `allowed_tools` list; no local binding needed. Bash
runs under the SDK's OS-level sandbox (bubblewrap on Linux) — reads are
unrestricted, writes are restricted to the specialist's workdir. Write
is deliberately absent: `pack_submission.py` would silently drop any
sidecar files the agent wrote next to train_gpt.py.

Streaming response
──────────────────
`await client.query(prompt)` returns None. We iterate
`client.receive_response()` to collect AssistantMessage / UserMessage /
ResultMessage events and pull out:
  * ToolUseBlocks the model emitted (count + match submit_trial's id)
  * ToolResultBlocks the SDK sent back for our tools (parse the MCP
    text payload to recover the row dict for submit_trial)
  * usage + session_id from the terminal ResultMessage

        Custom tools are namespaced `mcp__<server>__<tool>` — matches the

        scoped to `cwd` (set on ClaudeAgentOptions below) so the agent can
        only see / mutate files under its own workdir_<domain>/.

        Bash is enabled and runs under the SDK's OS-level sandbox
        (bubblewrap on Linux; see `sandbox=` in `run_once` below) — reads
        are unrestricted, writes are confined to cwd. That is how the
        agent can slice tree.tsv / results.tsv from the blackboard dir
        without being able to mutate them. Write is still absent: it
        would let the agent create sidecar files that `pack_submission.py`
        ignores, silently inflating the artifact.

        Honors `MAGENT_NO_LINEAGE=1`: see `_preload_tools` for rationale.
        Bash itself is kept (the agent needs it for own-workdir slicing
        and `wc` / `awk` on its own train_gpt.py); the
        `block_bash_blackboard` PreToolUse hook (agents/hooks.py) is what
        actually gates Bash reads of blackboard files.
